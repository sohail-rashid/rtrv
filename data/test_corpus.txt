1|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
2|A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
3|To be or not to be that is the question
4|All that glitters is not gold
5|A picture is worth a thousand words
6|Actions speak louder than words
7|The early bird catches the worm
8|Practice makes perfect
9|Time flies when you are having fun
10|Better late than never
